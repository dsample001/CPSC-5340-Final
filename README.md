# CPSC - 5340 Final Project

This is the finished Final Project for Daniel Sample.

## Investment App Project Details

This app is designed to show a user's stocks and the total value of each position.
It uses Firestore Cloud to authenticate the user and store each user's stock and the amount of each stock owned by the user.
It also uses an API from “MarketStack” to retrieve information about each stock, including price, company name and others.
MarketStack has free accounts but are limited to 100 requests a month.  For this project I am using a paid account with a 10,000 request limit.


## Requirements
1.  The application should do something useful and be of more complexity than the previous assignments. (200 points)

2. Make a video of you demoing your app. (100 points)

The video should be about 5-10 minutes and should cover,

            Why you chose to do this app
            How to use the app, including a demo
            Discussion of how the app works, including any particular challenges you faced,  and
            What would you change if you were to continue to work on the app.

3. Submit two links: One for the video, and one for your public or private GitHub repository (created by you).
